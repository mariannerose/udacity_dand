## P0: Analyze Bay Area bike share data
In this project I investigated a raw dataset and shared my findings using a Jupyter Notebook. Real-life data provided by Bay Area Bike Share was used to determine differences in usage between commuters and tourists' ridership patterns, average duration of trips, and more.

## P1: Test a perceptual phenomenon
In this project I used descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Giving my readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

## P2: Investigate a dataset
In this project I conducted my own data analysis on the team budgets in the Major League Baseball (MLB) using the [Lahman Baseball database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) (2016 version). I used pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I was most interested in, and created a report sharing the answers.

## P3: Wrangle OpenStreetMap data
For this project I used data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean OpenStreetMap data for Leiden, a city in the Netherlands.

## P4: Explore and summarize data
In this project I used R and applied exploratory data analysis techniques to explore data on economic and social characteristics of the counties of California population, broadband availability and election results of the 2016 presidential election. I used visualizations (including county maps) to show the differences between counties.

## P6: Make Effective Data Visualization
In this project I used Tableau to create a data visualization in Tableau that tells the story about the high rents, long commuting times and gentrifaction in the San Francisco Bay area.
