Projects for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

## P0: Analyze Bay Area bike share data
In this project I investigated a raw dataset and shared my findings using a Jupyter Notebook. Real-life data provided by Bay Area Bike Share was used to determine differences in usage between commuters and tourists' ridership patterns, average duration of trips, and more.

## P1: Test a perceptual phenomenon
In this project I used descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Giving my readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

## P2: Investigate a dataset
In this project I conducted my own data analysis on the team budgets in the Major League Baseball (MLB) using the [Lahman Baseball database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) (2016 version). I used pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I was most interested in, and created a report sharing the answers.
