## Datasets used
The used dataset is a combination of data for the state of California coming
from three main sources:

1. Economic and social characteristics of the population for 2015 were taken 
from the 2011-2015 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates by the [United States Census Bureau](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml).
2. Broadband availability from the [Federal Communication Commission](https://www.fcc.gov/general/broadband-deployment-data-fcc-form-477).
3. Presidential 2016 election results from the [Statewide Database at U.C. Berkeley Law](http://statewidedatabase.org/d10/g16.html).

The data is available per census tract. Census tracts are parts of a county. 
California has [8057 census tracts](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tallies/tractblock.html) 
and 58 counties. Each census tract has its own identification code, consisting 
of 11 digits. The first two digits present the state code (06 for California), 
the next three digits give the county code and the last 6 digits give the tract 
code. [(source)](https://transition.fcc.gov/form477/Geo/more_about_census_blocks.pdf)

Next to that the [tigris library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tigris/tigris.pdf) 
is used to find spatial data in order to plot census tracts, counties and 
urban/rural areas on maps. And the [maps library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/maps.pdf) for population numbers per city. 

### Census data
The data was available by census tract id (Id). The data did not came in 
one csv file, different files had to be uploaded and merged on the tract id. 
Only variables that were needed were kept, variables were renamed and the types 
were changed if needed for easier merging and plotting. 

Census variables:

* Id (tract id)
* population
* number of households (total_hh, owner_hh, renter_hh)
* household size (total_hhsize, renter_hhsize, owner_hhsize)
* median household income (median_income)
* participation rate
* unemployment rate
* poverty rate

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Load_the_Data}
# number of households (hh)
housing <- read.csv('ACS_15_5YR_B25009_with_ann.csv', skip = 1, 
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
                    )[, c('Id','Estimate..Total.','Estimate..Owner.occupied.',
                          'Estimate..Renter.occupied.')] 

# rename column names
names(housing) <- c('Id', 'total_hh', 'owner_hh', 'renter_hh')

# replace 0 to NA for tracts where all variables are 0 
housing$total_hh[with(housing, total_hh == 0)] <- NA
housing$owner_hh[is.na(housing$total_hh)] <- NA
housing$renter_hh[is.na(housing$total_hh)] <- NA

# average household size of occupied housing units by tenure
hh_size <- read.csv('ACS_15_5YR_B25010.csv',
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)[, c('GEO.id', 'HD01_VD02', 
                                                  'HD01_VD03', 'HD01_VD04')]

# rename column names
names(hh_size) <- c('Id', "total_hhsize", "owner_hhsize", "renter_hhsize")

# replace NA (blank cells) in owner_hhsize and renter_hhsize columns to 0
# not replacing NA for cells that have no values at all 
hh_size$owner_hhsize[with(hh_size, is.na(hh_size$owner_hhsize) & 
                            total_hhsize >0)] <- 0
hh_size$renter_hhsize[with(hh_size, is.na(hh_size$renter_hhsize) & 
                            total_hhsize >0)] <- 0

# incomes
income_ca <- read.csv('ACS_15_5YR_S1901_with_ann.csv', skip = 1, 
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE, 
                      na.strings = c('(X)','N', '-')
                      )[,c('Id', 'Households..Estimate..Median.income..dollars.')]

# rename column names
names(income_ca) <- c('Id', 'median_income')

# tranform the median_income values to integers
income_ca$median_income <- revalue(income_ca$median_income, 
                                   c("250,000+" = "250000"))
income_ca$median_income <- as.integer(income_ca$median_income)

# population per census tract
pop_ca <- read.csv('ACS_15_5YR_B01003_with_ann.csv', skip = 1, 
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)[,c('Id', 'Estimate..Total')]

# rename column
names(pop_ca) <- c('Id', 'population')

# employment
employment <- read.csv('ACS_15_5YR_S2301_with_ann.csv', skip = 1,
                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                       na.strings = c('-'))[,c('Id',                                  'Labor.Force.Participation.Rate..Estimate..Population.16.years.and.over', 'Unemployment.rate..Estimate..Population.16.years.and.over')]

names(employment) <- c('Id', 'participation_rate', 'unemployment_rate')

# poverty (rate for the total poplation)
poverty <- read.csv('ACS_15_5YR_S1701_with_ann.csv', skip = 1,
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                    na.strings = c('-'))[,c('Id', 'Percent.below.poverty.level..Estimate..Population.for.whom.poverty.status.is.determined')]

names(poverty) <- c('Id', 'poverty_rate')
```

The census data was combined with data that mapped the county ids to the county
names [(source)](https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/reference/codes/files/st06_ca_cou.txt). 
Some wrangling was needed; variables were combined, revalued and renamed. 

Added variables:

* county (county id, in format 06###)
* county_name

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# county codes & names
codes <- read.csv("coding.csv", 
                      header = FALSE, 
                      colClasses = "character" # to keep leading zeros
                      )[,c('V2', 'V3', 'V4')] 

# combine state and county ids
codes$county <- paste0(codes$V2,codes$V3, collapse = NULL)

# remove County from county names
codes$county_name <- removeWords(codes$V4, ' County')

# rename county column and only keep county, county_id and county_name
names(codes)[2] <- 'county_id'
codes <- codes[,c(2,4:5)]
```

Data on the number of square miles per census tract was also added [(source)](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2016&layergroup=Census+Tracts). The surface was given in square meters so this was converted to square miles. 

Added variable:

* square_miles

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# square miles per census tract
square <- read.dbf("tract_coord.dbf", as.is = FALSE)[, c('GEOID', 'ALAND')]

# change format of Id from factor to character & add 1400000US for merging
square$GEOID <- paste0('1400000US', as.character(square$GEOID))

# convert square meters to square miles and round to integer
square$ALAND <- square$ALAND * 3.86102e-7

# rename columns
names(square) <- c('Id', 'square_miles')
```

After merging and joining the data the population per square miles was added.   

Added variable:

* pop_sqmiles (population per square mile)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Merge_census_data}
# combine census datasets
merged <- Reduce(function(x, y) merge(x, y, all = TRUE), 
                 list(housing, hh_size, income_ca, employment, poverty, square))
census <- left_join(merged, pop_ca, by = 'Id')

# change Id to 11 digits tract id
census$Id <- substr(census$Id, 10, 21)

# add column for county id (06###)
census$county <- substr(census$Id, 1,5)

# add county name
census <- left_join(census, codes[, c('county', 'county_name')], by = c('county' = 'county'))

# add population per square mile
census$pop_sqmiles <- census$population / census$square_miles

# reorder columns
census <- census[, c(1, 14:15, 13, 2:12, 16)]
```

### Broadband data
I read an article that broadband internet is not available in all areas of
California, I therefore decided to add data on broadband availability and see if
there were any relations with the census data. 

The FCC provides data on availability by census block (which is part of a census 
tract). Data was therefore grouped and summarized by tract. As the data was 
skewed, it was decided to calculate the median per tract instead of the mean. 
Only data for tracts where providers can or do offer consumer service were 
included. Some other tidying up was done for merging reasons. [(source)](https://www.fcc.gov/general/explanation-broadband-deployment-data) 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Load_more_Data}
# load the broadband dataset for California, keeping only the relevant columns
broadband_ca <- read.csv("CA-Fixed-Jun2016-v2.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE
                         )[,c('DBAName', 'BlockCode', 'TechCode', 'Consumer', 
                              'MaxAdDown', 'MaxAdUp')]

# replace scientific format with human readable format and add 0 to have the  
# full 15-digit block code
broadband_ca$BlockCode <- 
  paste0("0", 
         format(broadband_ca$BlockCode, scientific = FALSE), 
         collapse = NULL)

# isolate first 11 characters for tract code
broadband_ca$Id <- substr(broadband_ca$BlockCode, 1, 11)

# only keep information for companies that provide broadband to consumers
broadband_cons <- subset(broadband_ca, Consumer == 1)

# find mean and max upload and download speeds + number of providers per tract
broadband <- broadband_cons %>% 
  group_by(Id) %>% 
    dplyr::summarise(median_down = median(MaxAdDown),
                    median_up = median(MaxAdUp),
                    nr_providers = length(unique(DBAName)))
```

Variables:

* Id (tract id)
* median_down (median maximum advertised downstream speed/bandwith)
* median_up (median maximum advertised upstream speed/bandwith)
* nr_providers

### Voting data
It seemed interesting how the census and broadban data intereacts with the 
voting results in the last presidential election. The voting data was provided 
by precinct instead of census blocks or tracts, therefore the voting results had 
to be mapped from precincts to census blocks and then summarized by census tracts. 
Note that precincts can cover multiple blocks and parts of blocks. 

One dataset contained the voting results per precinct. Another contained the
mapping from precincts to census blocks as well as which part of the
total registered votes in that precinct were registered in that block. These 
tables were combined to find the number of total votes for a [particular party](http://statewidedatabase.org/pub/data/G16/G16_SOR_codebook.txt) per 
census tract. A categorical variable, winner, was added to determine the winner 
per tract.

Voting variables:

* Id (tract id)
* total_vote (total number of casted votes)
* dem (percentage of votes for Democratic Party)
* rep (percentage of votes for Republican Party)
* winner (Democrats, Republicans, draw)

Note: 

* Other parties participated as well in the presidential elections, but
as they received a small % of the votes it was decided to not include them.
* I have chosen to correct the dataset for voting data which were incorrectly 
mapped to a water-only tract. I have notified the creators of the dataset. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Load_evenmore_Data}
# voting numbers per precinct

# only keep precinct number and president voting results & change format

                              ifelse(voting_tract$dem < voting_tract$rep, 
                                     "Republicans", 
                                     ifelse(voting_tract$dem == voting_tract$rep, 
                                            "draw", NA)))

# rename columns
names(voting_tract)[1] <- 'Id'
```

```{r echo=FALSE, Merge_Datasets}
# combine census and voting data
census_voting <- left_join(census, voting_tract, by = "Id")

# all combined data
data <- left_join(census_voting, broadband, by = 'Id')

# save combined datasets to csv
write.csv(data, file = 'project5_data.csv')
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# upload data, remove first column added when transforming to csv
data <- read.csv('project5_data.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)[,c(2:24)]

# replace scientific format with human readable format and add 0 to have the  
# full Id and county values
data$Id <- paste0("0", format(data$Id, scientific = FALSE), 
         collapse = NULL)
data$county <- paste0('0',data$county, collapse = NULL)
```

## Univariate Analysis
The three different datasets were joined, which left us with a dataset of 8,057 
observations for 23 variables. California has 8,057 census tracts. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dim(data)
```

As the social and economic variables come from a census, it can be expected that 
not all variables are available for each census tract. I will explore what data 
is missing when looking at the individual variables. 

### Counties
California has 58 counties. Not ever county has the same number of tracts, it 
varies widly from only 1 (Alpine & Sierra) to 2,346 tracts (LA). The median is 
42 tractcs and the mean 138.9. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# get the number of tracts per county
tracts_county <- 
  data %>% 
  group_by(county_name) %>% 
  dplyr :: summarise(nr_of_tracts = n())
  
summary(tracts_county$nr_of_tracts)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# barplot of counties ordered by number of tracts
ggplot(data = tracts_county, 
       #to order by count instead of name
       aes(x = reorder(county_name, -nr_of_tracts), 
           y = nr_of_tracts)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  # get readable county names
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.4)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 2400, 100))
```

### Census data
#### Population
The population in the tracts is also very diverse. From 0 to 39,454 people. 
The mean and median are 4,769 and 4,528 respectively. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(data$population)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# histogram for population size
histogram(data, "population", 500, 
          TRUE, 12000, 1000,
          TRUE, 2000, 100,
          TRUE, data$population, 0.99)
```

As the distribution is long tailed I zoomed in to the data so it only shows 99% 
of the values. Most tracts have a population between 3,000 and 6,000 people. 
The optimun size of a tract is [4,000 people](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_ct.html). 
45 tracts have a population of zero. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# find number of tracts with zero population
length(which(data$population == 0))
```

##### Zero population
Looking into this further I found that California has 21 tracts that are [water-only](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tallies/tractblock.html). 
These tracts can be identified by the fact that their ids are in the range of the 
9900s. Next to that tracts that have an id in the range of 9800s are special
land-use census tracts, such as large parks or employment areas with little or 
no residential population [(source)](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_ct.html).
I added a variable to mark these special tracts. 

Variable added:

* special (values: water, special_land or regular)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# mark tracts as water-only, special land use or regular
data$special <- ifelse(substr(data$Id,6,7) == '98', 'special_land',
                            ifelse(substr(data$Id,6,7) == '99', 'water', 
                                   'regular'))

# create bar plot for tracts with zero population
bar(subset(data, population == 0), 20, 2)
```

As can seen above, most of the tracts that have zero population are indeed either 
water-only or special land use tracts. However three tracts, 2 in LA and 1 in San 
Diego have no special indication. I looked up the tracts on this [website](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/14000US06037504102-census-tract-320000-los-angeles-ca/), where you can see the tract on a map. The tract in San Diego is water, one of 
the LA tracts is the area where Universal Studios is located and the other tract 
seems to be a business park. In all three cases it seems the tract id should 
start with either 9900 or 9800.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include = FALSE}
# tract ids that have no population and are not marked as water or special land
subset(subset(data, population == 0), special == 'regular')$Id
```

I used the tigris library to find all counties and tracts in California and their 
lat and longs. Please note that only information is available for 8043 tracts, 
14 tracts are water-only and are not included in the tigris library. I assume 
they are out of range of the state land boundaries. In order to plot the 
information I used this [tutorial](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/making-maps-with-R.html).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# lat & long for the counties and tracts to be able to show borders
counties_all <- tigris :: counties(state = 06, cb = TRUE)
tracts_all <- tigris :: tracts(state = '06', county = c(codes$county_id), cb = TRUE)

# changes data from SpatialPolygonsDataFrame to regular (and plotting friendly)
# dataframe 
ggcounties <- fortify(counties_all, region = 'GEOID')
ggtract <- fortify(tracts_all, region = "GEOID")

# combine ggtract with data
data_geo <- left_join(ggtract, data, by = c('id' = 'Id'))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# show zero population tracts on map of California
zero_pop <- subset(data_geo, population == 0)
map(ggcounties, zero_pop, TRUE, 'special')
```

As can be clearly seen Lake Tahoe is made up of water-only tracts. The nothern 
islands of the Channel Island which are a [national park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands_(California)#Characteristics) 
are clearly marked as special land use tracts. Most special tracts lie in the 
Los Angeles county. Not all tracts are visible either because they are small or 
lie beyond the state land borders (for water-only tracts).

I decided to remove these 45 tracts due to their zero population, which results 
in a dataset of 8012 tracts (+ 24 variables).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create dataset with removed tracts
no_pop <- subset(data, population == 0)
no_pop$type <- 'no_population'

# remove zero population tracts, keeping 8012 tracts
data <- subset(data, population > 0)
dim(data)

# also remove zero population tracts from dataset with lat & longs
data_geo <- subset(data_geo, population > 0)
```

#### Square miles
The size of the tracts is very diverse. The smallest track represent a 2 by 2
block in San Francisco while the largest tracts are close to 6,950 square miles 
(one tract contains Death Valley NP and the other Mojavo National Preserve). 
75% of the tracts have a size of less than 1.787 square miles (3rd quantile).  

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(data$square_miles)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# histogram square miles
histogram(data, 'square_miles', NULL, xscale = FALSE, yscale = TRUE, 
          coord = FALSE, yend = 1500, ystep = 200) 
```

Even when the axis are transformed (log10), the distribtuion still has a long 
tail. 86% of the tracts are smaller than 5 square miles. Smaller tracts are more
common than large tracts. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# calculate % of tracts that are equal or smaller than 5 square miles
nrow(subset(data, square_miles < 5)) / nrow(data) * 100
```

#### Population per square mile
As the distributions for both population and square miles are very diverse, it
is unsurprisely that the population per square miles is also very diverse. From 
0.37 to 173,337 people per square mile. With a median of 6,316 and a mean of 
8,607 people. Numbers like 173,337 people per square mile seems very high, but 
can be explained by highly dense populated small tracts (couple of blocks) in 
cities.  

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(data$pop_sqmiles)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# histogram population per square mile
histogram(data, 'pop_sqmiles', NULL, xscale = FALSE, 
          yscale = FALSE, coord = FALSE)
```

The distribution is a mirror of the square miles distribution. Most tracts have 
a population between 2,500 and 10,000 people per square mile. 

#### Households
Households can be split up in two groups, households that are owning their house 
and households that are renting. The average home ownership for all tracts is 
54.2%, the median is 56.9%. Data is not available for 28 tracts. 

Variable added:

* owner (percentage of households that own their house)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# calculate which percentage of renter or owner households
data$owner <- (data$owner_hh / data$total_hh) * 100

# calculate summary for both variables
summary(data$owner)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# histogram household owner
histogram(data, 'owner', 10, xscale = TRUE, xend = 100, xstep = 10,  
          yscale = FALSE, yend = 1200, ystep = 200, coord = FALSE)
```

Percentage home ownership is sort of linear till 70%, when it drops. Interesting 
to see is that there are more tracts were all households are renters (0% owner) 
than tracts where everybody is an owner, which makes sense as it is less likely 
that everyone owns their house in a particular tract but especially in cities it 
is not as unlikely that everybody rents. 

#### Household size
The median and mean household size is 3 persons (rounded). Data is not available
for 30 tracts.

``````{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(data$total_hhsize)
```


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# histogram household size
histogram(data, 'total_hhsize', 1, xscale = TRUE, xend = 10, xstep = 1,  
          yscale = FALSE, coord = FALSE)
```

When we look at the histogram is seems that very few tracts (61) have an average 
household size of more than 5 members. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
length((subset(data, total_hhsize > 5))$Id)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(data[,c('owner_hhsize', 'renter_hhsize')])
```

Renter households are slightly larger than owner households, but the range is 
larger for owner households.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# distribution of household sizes for renter and owner households
ggplot(data = data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = renter_hhsize), binwidth = 0.1, fill = 'blue',
                 position="dodge", alpha = 1/5) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = owner_hhsize), binwidth = 0.1, fill = 'green',
                 position="dodge", alpha = 1/5) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma, breaks = seq(0, 12, 1)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, quantile(data$owner_hhsize, 0.999, 
                                       na.rm = TRUE))) +
  xlab('household size')
```

When looking at the distribtutions for both renter (blue) and owner (green) 
household sizes, we see that the owner distribtuion is taller and peaks around 3
people, while for renters there is a less distinguish peak. There are more renter 
households with 4 or 5 people, which is kind of surprising as you would expect 
that people who own their house to be older, financially able to buy a house and 
maybe have live in children than in general younger renters. However with the 
current housing situation in parts of California (like the San Francisco Bay 
area) this general rule might not be valid as more people are sharing housing 
with non-family members. 

The peak at 0 is when there are really zero renter or owner households in that 
tract, or a very low number and then the variable was not computed by the Census
Burea. 

#### Median income
The median income shows which income was at the midpoint of a frequency 
distibution. For California there are quite some high outliers which pulls the 
mean up. The median and mean of the median income are respectively 60,530 and 
67,334 dollar. With 75% of the tracts having a median income of 84,704 dollar or 
less. For 53 tracts there is no median income data available.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(data$median_income)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# histogram median income with log10 x axis
histogram(data, 'median_income', NULL, xscale = FALSE, yscale = TRUE, 
          yend = 1000, ystep = 100, coord = FALSE)
```

As the distribution is long tailed, the x axis is transformed (log 10) and we 
see a (somewhat whimsical) normal distribution. There is a huge jump at 30,000 
dollar of tracts that have that median income.

##### Missing values
There are 53 missing values for the median income. I used the [naniar library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/naniar/vignettes/naniar-visualisation.html) 
to visualize the other variables that are missing for these 57 tracts. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# find number of missing values per tract
gg_miss_var(subset(data, is.na(median_income)))
```

The plot shows the number of other variables (especially census variables) that 
are also missing. When scrolling to the data it became clear that the tracts that 
that are missing census variable are missing multiple. The missing voting 
variables seem to be affecting other tracts. 

Of the variables that have no missing values the participation rate stands out 
as it is the only census variable that has no missing values (note that population 
variable already has been cleaned for zero values). 


#### Participation rate
The paricipation rate is clustered around the mean and median, that lie both 
around 63-64%. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(data$participation_rate)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# histogram participation rate
histogram(data, 'participation_rate', 1, xscale = TRUE, xend = 100, xstep = 5,
          yscale = TRUE, yend = 500, ystep = 50, coord = FALSE)
```

The distribution looks normal. It is interesting that there are a number of 
tracts that have a partipation rate of 0 or 100%. Wondering about this as 
participation rate did not have any missing values for the 53 tracts that were 
missing many other (census) variables. 

##### 0% & 100%
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create subset for tracts that have a participation rate of 0 or 100
data_part <- subset(data, (participation_rate == 0 | 
                             participation_rate == 100))

# create bar plot for tracts with 0 or 100% participation rate
bar(data_part, 5, 1) + 
  # I used this to show both cases in one chart
  facet_grid(~participation_rate)
```

I noticed that almost all tracts that have a participation rate of 100% are 
special land tracts. The tract in San Diego, is the airport so this probably 
should also be special_land tract.

I looked up some of the 0% tracts [here](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/14000US06037574700-census-tract-980014-los-angeles-ca/) 
and found that often only a prison or detention center was located in these
tracts (regardless if they were marked special_land or not). I also noticed that 
when looking up some of these tracts, that their population is mainly male. I 
therefore added a variable for the male percentage of the population to this 
subset. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# upload data on gender
gender <- read.csv('ACS_15_5YR_S0601_with_ann.csv', skip = 1,
                   na.strings = '-', stringsAsFactors = TRUE
                   )[, c('Id', 'Total..Estimate..SEX...Male')]

# change Id to 11 digits tract id
gender$Id <- substr(gender$Id, 10, 21)

# rename column
names(gender) <- c('Id', 'male')

# join male column with data dataset
data_part <- left_join(data_part, gender, by = c('Id' = 'Id'))

# plot 0% participation tracts for their male percentage
histogram(subset(data_part, participation_rate == 0), 'male', 1, 
          xscale = FALSE, yscale = TRUE, yend = 11, ystep = 1, coord = FALSE)
```

Only two tracts have a lower male percentage than expected. The tract with 50% 
is a special area and is a national park. The second lowest is a tract where only 
a VA medical center is located. All other tracts seem to be tracts with either 
prisons or detention centers. 

The tracts for which the median income was missing seemed to overlap with the 
tracts that have a 0 or 100% participation rate as can be seen in the plot below 
that shows missing values for this subset. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# missing values for 0 or 100% participation rate tracts
gg_miss_var(subset(data_part))
```

I therefore decided to drop the tracts for which the median income is missing, 
which leaves us with a dataset of 7,959 tracts (+ 25 variables).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# missing median income tracts
median <- subset(data, is.na(median_income))[,c(1:24)] # remove last added column
median$type <- 'no_income'

# combine all tracts that have missing variables
missing <- rbind(no_pop, median)

# remove tracts from dataset
data <- subset(data, !is.na(median_income))
dim(data)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(data$participation_rate)
```

The statistics have not changed a lot, except that the min value is no longer 0, 
and the 100% partipation rates are only for special_land tracts in parks.

#### Unemployment rate
The unemployment rate ranges from 0 to 60.5%. The mean unemployment rate is 
10.16% and the median 9.30%. There is a very long long tail. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(data$unemployment_rate)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# histogram unemployment rate
histogram(data, 'unemployment_rate', 1, 
          TRUE, 28, 2, 
          TRUE, 800, 100,
          TRUE, data$unemployment_rate, 0.99)
```

When only taking into account values that lie in the 99% range, we still see a 
longtail, but most tracts have a unemployment rate that is less than 16%. 

#### Poverty rate
The poverty rate ranges from 0 to 91.8%. The mean is 16.49% and the median is 
13.30%. Also here there is a long tail. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(data$poverty_rate)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# histogram poverty rate
histogram(data, 'poverty_rate', 1, 
          TRUE, 55, 5, 
          TRUE, 400, 50,
          TRUE, data$poverty_rate, 0.95)
```

Even when looking at only 95% of the values there is still a long tail. Most 
tracts have a poverty rate between 5 and 10%. It is not surprising that there is 
a longtail as higher poverty rates are more unlikely.

### Broadband data
#### Download speed
Note that broadband data had to be summarized, the median was calculated per 
tract as the distribution on block level was very long tailed. The median 
advertised download speed ranges between 2 and 40 Mbps. There is one missing 
value.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(data$median_down)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# histogram broadband speed for downloads
histogram(data, 'median_down', 1, 
          TRUE, 40, 5, 
          TRUE, 5000, 500,
          FALSE)
```

The median and 3rd quartile are both 15. This is also clear from the histogram, 
there are also peaks at 12, 25 and 30 Mbps.

#### Upload speed
Median advertised upload speed ranges from 1 to 20 Mbps. The mean and median 
are respectively 2 and 2.8 Mbps. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(data$median_up)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# histogram broadband speed for uploads
histogram(data, 'median_up', 1, 
          TRUE, 20, 2, 
          TRUE, 5000, 500,
          FALSE)
```

There are only 384 (4.8%) tracts that have a median upload speed higher than 3 
Mbps. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nrow(subset(data, median_up >3))
```

#### Number of providers
Overal, tracts have on average ~7 providers (also the median).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(data$nr_providers)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# histogram # of broadband providers
histogram(data, 'nr_providers', 1, 
          TRUE, 14, 1, 
          TRUE, 2750, 250,
          FALSE)
```

50% of the tracts have between 6 and 8 providers (IQR). 

### Voting data
#### Voting participation
It seemed interesting to see the voting participation, calculating the total 
votes casted divided by the population per tract.

Variable added:

* voting_part (total votes divided by population)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create variable for voting participation
data$voting_part <- (data$total_vote / data$population) * 100
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(data$voting_part)
```

The median and mean are ~ 39%, meaning that 39% of the population per tract voted. 
Data for 31 tracts is missing.

As population is made up also from non-eligble voters (children etc) we are not 
expecting to see 100%+ values. 11 tracts have a a voting participation of more 
than 100%, but more tracts might be affected. I can think of two reasons why this 
is happening:

1. Votes might have been assigned incorrectly when mapping from precincts to 
blocks. I have gone over this a couple of times and I cannot find where it goes 
wrong in my mapping, so I am not sure if there is something in the original 
mapping files or my method. 
2. Population and total votes number come from different datasets, so maybe 
numbers are assigned to wrong tracts. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# how many tracts have a voting participation of more than 100
nrow(subset(data, voting_part > 100))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# subset with only percentages lower or equal to 100
vot_100 <- subset(data, voting_part <= 100) 
summary(vot_100$voting_part)
```

Removing these 11 tracts, does not do much to the median and mean. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# voting participation distribution
histogram(vot_100, 'voting_part', 5, 
          TRUE, 120, 10, 
          TRUE, 1000, 100,
          FALSE)
```

The distribution looks relatively normal, with not a clear peak though. 75% of 
the tracts have a voting participation of 50% or less.

##### Missing values
Data for 31 tracts is missing. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# plot tracts with missing voting data
vparticipation <- subset(data, is.na(voting_part))

data_geo <- left_join(ggtract, vparticipation, by = c('id' = 'Id'))

map(ggcounties, subset(data_geo, !is.na(county)), FALSE, 'orange') +
  # zoom in south of California where the tracts are located
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-120, -114),  ylim = c(32.5, 35), ratio = 1.3)
```

Plotting these tracts on a map shows that the whole county of Imperial is missing 
(the white tract was already dropped before) plus one tract in LA. Checking back 
with the database it notes that the data is not yet available for these tracts.

All census and broad variables are available for these tracts, so I am not 
dropping them. When looking at voting data these tracts will not be included.  

#### Democrats vs Republicans
The added variable 'winner', shows which party got the most votes. In almost 
6,500 tracts the Democratic party got the most votes. That is 80% of thet racts. 
(Tracts without a winner are in Imperial & LA, see above.)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# plot winner per tract
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = winner)) +
  stat_count(labels = TRUE) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 6500, 500))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# % of tracts where the Democratic party got the most votes
nrow(subset(data, winner == 'Democrats')) / nrow(data) * 100
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# calculate which percentage of votes are for the R o D party
summary(data[, c('dem', 'rep')])
```

For all tracts the median and mean percentage votes for Democrats are 64.34 and 
62.13% respectively. The median and mean are 25.83 and 28.59% for the Republicans.
The Democratic party is more popular than the Republican party in the Californian
tracts.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# histograms dems and reps
dems <- histogram(subset(data, winner == 'Democrats'), 'dem', 5, TRUE, 100, 5,
                  TRUE, 900, 100, FALSE)

reps <- histogram(subset(data, winner == 'Republicans'), 'rep', 5, 
                  xscale =TRUE, 100, 5, yscale = FALSE, coord = FALSE)

grid.arrange(dems, reps)
```

The histograms show the distribution for the tracts were the party was the 
largest. Please note that not 50% of the votes is needed as multiple parties 
participated. It is clear that if the Democrats won, they mostly did with a 
higher percentage of the votes on average 68% vs 54% for the Republicans. The 
Republican distribution peaks before 50%, while the Democrats one only peaks at
70% and its distribution is more level. Also the maximal percentage of votes is
lower for the Republicans, 10%-point.

``````{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# find median and mean for tracts where the Democratic party was the largest
summary(subset(data, winner == 'Democrats')$dem)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# find median and mean for tracts where the Republican party was the largest
summary(subset(data, winner == 'Republicans')$rep)
```

### Summary
#### Structure
All together 45 (for having no population value) plus 53 tracts (for not having 
median income value) have been dropped. Which leaves us with data for 7959 tracts 
(+ 26 variables).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dim(data)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# combine ggtract with data
missing_geo <- left_join(ggtract, missing, by = c('id' = 'Id'))

# plot all removed tracts
map(ggcounties, subset(missing_geo, !is.na(type)), TRUE, 'type')
```

The dropped tracts are shown on the map. As can be seen it is only a couple of 
tracts per county, except for LA but LA has many tracts. We also know that these 
dropped tracts are either not inhabited or are water, special areas (national 
parks, business parks or jails/detention centers). Next to their special 
character also the multiple missing variables for these tracts justifies to not 
take them into account in the exploration.

There are 26 variables:

* Tract info - 4 (Id, county, county_name, special)
* Census variables - 14 (population, total_hh, owner_hh, renter_hh, total_hhsize, 
owner_hhsize, renter_hhsize, owner, median_income, participation_rate, 
unemployment_rate, poverty_rate, square_miles, pop_sqmiles)
* Broadband variables - 3 (median_down, median_up, nr_providers)
* Voting variables - 5 (total_vote, dem, rep, winner, voting_part)

When plotting the tracts on a map, 6 addditonal variables (including langitude 
and longitude coordinates) are needed. 

#### Interesting variables
I am mostly interested in how population per square miles interacts with the other 
variables. And also how the median income and the winner (Democrats/Republicans) 
relate to other variables. I am also interested if certain tracts have less or 
more access to broadband. 

The first exploration has shown that the census tracts in California are very 
diverse in size, income, politic color but also other social and economic 
variables. It will be interesting to see if there are difference between 
poor/rich tracts, Democrat or Republican tracts and low/high populated tracts.

#### New variables
Five variables were created:

* pop_sqmiles (population divided by square miles)
* winner (categorical variable showing party with most votes)
* special (specify track as water_only, special_ land or regular)
* voting_part (total votes divided by population)
* owner (% of households that own their housing)

## Bivariate Analysis
I decided not to look at variables that are absolute numbers (like population, 
household size, the total number votes and square miles) as the tracts are so 
diverse. It seems more logic to look at these variables adjusted for size (like 
owner, population per square mile and voting participation). 

The correlation matrix below shows that some variables correlate with other 
variables (shown in dark red or blue), but others clearly do not correlate at all 
(faint blue or red). Blue shows a positive correlation, red a negative one.
 
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# include only numeric columns
data_num <- data[, sapply(data, is.numeric)]

# create correlation matrix
data_cor <- psych :: lowerCor(data_num)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# show correlation matrix graphically
cor.plot(data_cor, n = 22, xlas = 2, diag = FALSE, 
         numbers = TRUE, cex = 0.5, cex.axis = 0.8, 
         select = c("pop_sqmiles", "median_income",  "total_hhsize", 
                    "owner_hhsize", "renter_hhsize", "owner", "participation_rate", 
                    "unemployment_rate", "poverty_rate", "voting_part", "dem", 
                    "rep", "median_down", "median_up", "nr_providers"))
```

### Broadband variables
Interesting is that the broadband variables (median_down, median_up and 
nr_providers) show no meaningful correlation at all with the other variables in 
the dataset, except among themselves. Up and download speeds are not even 
very strongly correlated (0.59). 

I was kind of expecting that higher broadband speeds would be available in higher 
populated and maybe higher income tracts. It might be that this been influenced
by the fact that the median per tract had to be calculated. 

### Population per square mile
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# get all lat & long from CA cities from the maps library
# numbers are old but the same cities are still the largest
data(us.cities)
ca_cities <- subset(us.cities, country.etc == 'CA')

# selecting cities with a population higher than 300,000 in df 
top_cities <- subset(ca_cities, pop > 300000)

write.csv(ca_cities, 'ca_cities.csv')
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# join data with tract
data_geo <- left_join(ggtract, data, by = c('id' = 'Id'))

# create intervals for cut_format function (based on cut_number)
breaks <- c(0, 5, 25, 100, 250, 1500, 5000, 10000, 175000)

# plot population per square mile
map(ggcounties, data_geo, TRUE, 'cut_format(pop_sqmiles, breaks)') +
  scale_fill_brewer('population per square mile', 
                    palette = 'GnBu', na.value = 'grey') +
  # add top 12 cities (300.000 people or more)
  geom_point(data = top_cities, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = NULL), 
             size = 0.1, color = 'red')
```

We see that the areas that have a high population density are around the big 
cities (+300,000, from maps library). San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose 
in the Bay area, Sacramento in Nothern California. Fresno and Bakersfield in the 
Valley. Anaheim, Santa Ana, LA, Anaheim and Riverside in the larger LA area and 
San Diego in the South.

The cities are indicated as point, they can only be mapped to one tract while 
multiple tracts can make up a city. I therefore looked if there was another way 
to visualize this.

#### Vs type
I looked for data marking rural and urban areas.The [Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/ua/urban-rural-2010.html) 
identifies two types of urban areas:

* urbanized areas, 50,000 or more people
* urban clusters, at least 2,500 and less than 50,000 people

Rural areas are areas that are not included in one of the two urban types. 

I again used the tigris library to find the urbanized areas and urban clusters.
I used this [tutorial](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/scicomp/usecases/point-in-polygon)
to find a way to know if urbanized areas or urban clusters are located in a 
tract. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# find all urbanized areas and urban clusters
urban_all <- tigris :: urban_areas(cb = TRUE)

# find all urbanized areas and clusters in CA
# some names have two states seperated by --, selecting 6 last characters if --
# present we take the state abbreviation before -- otherwise just the last 2 
# characters
urban_all$state <- str_sub(urban_all$NAME10, -6)
urban_all$state <- ifelse(grepl('--', urban_all$state, fixed=TRUE) == TRUE, 
                          substr(urban_all$state, 1, 2), 
                          substr(urban_all$state, 5, 6))

# select only areas and clusters in California
urban_ca <- subset(urban_all, state == "CA")

# add city code to tracts_all table, so we know which tracts are part of 
# an urbanized area of urban cluster
proj4string(urban_ca) <- proj4string(tracts_all)
tracts_all$city <- over(tracts_all,urban_ca)$AFFGEOID10

# change data from SpatialPolygonsDataFrame to regular dataframe 
tracts_city <- as.data.frame(tracts_all[, c('COUNTYFP', 'GEOID', 'city')])

# add area (U) or cluster (C) indicator
urban_city <- as.data.frame(urban_ca)[, c('AFFGEOID10', 'GEOID10', 
                                          'NAME10', 'UATYP10')]
tracts_city <- left_join(tracts_city, urban_city, 
                         by = c('city'= 'AFFGEOID10'))

# replace NA cells with 'R' for rural tracts
tracts_city[, 'UATYP10'][is.na(tracts_city[, 'UATYP10'])] <- 'R'

# change column name (rural/urban)
names(tracts_city)[6] <- 'type'

# merge with the rest of the data
data <- left_join(data, tracts_city[,c('GEOID','type')], by = c('Id' = 'GEOID'))

data$type <- ifelse(data$type == 'U', "urbanized areas", 
                    ifelse(data$type == 'C', "urban clusters", 'rural'))

# make type variable a factor with levels from urbanized to rural
data$type <- factor(data$type, levels = c('urbanized areas', 
                                          'urban clusters', 'rural'))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# combine ggtract with data
data_geo <- left_join(ggtract, data, by = c('id' = 'Id'))

# plot rural/urban areas on map
map(ggtract, data_geo, TRUE, 'type') +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c('dodgerblue4', 'dodgerblue2', 'lightskyblue'), 
                      na.value ='wheat')
```

Plotted we see the same pattern, in dark blue you see the urbanized areas 
which are indeed where we expect them to be but are more extensive as whole 
tracts are now marked. Same is true for the urban clusters. Few tracts in the 
north and east of the state have no urban cluster or urbanized areas.

I added this variable as a second categorical variable so that tracts can be 
compared on the type of tract. 

Variable added:

* type (urbanized areas, urban clusters, rural)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# boxplot of population per square mile vs type
boxplot(data, 'type', 'pop_sqmiles', 1/10, yscale = TRUE, 30000, 5000, 
        coord = TRUE, data$pop_sqmiles, 0.95)
```

As expected the median population per square mile is much higher in urbanized 
areas than in urban clusters and rural tracts caused by smaller tracts with 
bigger poulations. Only 95% of the values are shown as there are many outliers 
for the urbanized areas tracts.

#### Vs median income

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# population per square miles vs median income
scatter(data, xvar = 'pop_sqmiles', yvar = 'median_income', 1/25, 
        xscale = FALSE, yscale = FALSE, coord = FALSE)
```

There is a weak negative correlation (-0.26) between the median income and 
population per square mile. As both variables are longtailed, they are plotted
both on a log 10 scale. The correlation seems to be positively at low levels, but 
becomes more dense (most tracts have pop_sqmiles between 5 and 10,000) and gets 
a negative direction. Incomes under 30,000 dollar are more likely to be in highly
populated tracts. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# boxplot for median income per type
boxplot(data, xvar = 'type', yvar = 'median_income', 1/10, 
        yscale = TRUE, 250000, 25000, coord = FALSE)
```

Median incomes are higher in urbanized areas (U) than in the urban clusters and 
rural tracts. The median incomes in the last two are pretty similar. 

#### Vs winner

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# only tracts for which there are voting results
data_vot <- subset(data, !is.na(winner))

# boxplot of population per square mile vs winner
boxplot(data_vot, 'winner', 'pop_sqmiles', 1/10, yscale = TRUE, 30000, 5000, 
        coord = TRUE, data$pop_sqmiles, 0.95)
```

If we look at the population per square mile, it is clear that in general the 
Democratic tracts are more densely populated than the Republican tracts. Note 
that only 95% of the values are shown due to high outliers for the Democrat 
tracts.

#### Vs owner

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# population per square miles vs ownership
scatter(data, 'pop_sqmiles', 'owner', 1/25, 
        xscale = FALSE, yscale = FALSE, coord = FALSE)
```

There is a negative correlation between population per square mile and ownership 
(-0.55). Meaning that more people live in a tract, ownership by households is
lower. This pattern becomes stronger at 5,000 people per square mile. This makes 
sense as we would expect house ownership to be lower in less populated areas. 
Especially as in parts of California housing prices are the highest in the 
country and owning a house is not a possibility for a large part of the population. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# boxplot for ownership per type
boxplot(data, 'type', 'owner', 1/10, yscale = TRUE, 100, 10, coord = FALSE)
```

And indeed if we look at the three different types, median home ownership is 
highest in rural areas, slightly above 70% and lowest in urbanized areas at 
slightly above 55%. 

#### Vs poverty rate

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# population per square miles vs poverty rate
scatter(data, xvar = 'pop_sqmiles', yvar = 'poverty_rate', 1/25, xscale = FALSE, 
        yscale = FALSE, coord = TRUE, col = data$poverty_rate, ci = 0.99)
```

The correlation between the poverty rate and population per square mile is weak 
(0.31). It seems that till 1,000 people per square mile the relation is 0, but
it becoome positive after 5,000 people although there it is still very disperse.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# boxplot for poverty_rate per type
boxplot(data, 'type', 'poverty_rate', 1/5, yscale = TRUE, 100, 5, coord = FALSE)
```

Median poverty rate is highest in tracts that are marked as urbanized clusters 
(17.4%) and lowest in urbanized areas (12.9%). It is good to notice that the 
range as well as the number of outliers is larger in tracts marked as urbanized 
areas.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# calculate medians for the three types
data %>% group_by(type) %>% 
  dplyr :: summarise(median_poverty = median(poverty_rate))
```

#### Vs uneployment rate

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# boxplot for poverty_rate per type
boxplot(data, 'type', 'unemployment_rate', 1/10, yscale = TRUE, 36, 2, coord = TRUE,
        data$unemployment_rate, 0.999)
```

Unemployment rates are highest in rural areas (11.8%), but only slightly higher 
than in urban clusters (11.6%). For 75% of the urbanized areas tracts the rate is 
under 12.5%, but most top outliers are also in this group.  

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# calculate medians for the three types
data %>% group_by(type) %>% 
  dplyr :: summarise(median_poverty = median(unemployment_rate))
```

Combining both results it seems that unemployment is less correlated with poverty 
in rural areas than in urban clusters.

#### Vs voting participation
Note that only tracts with a voting participation of 100% or less are taken into
account.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# only tracts that have a voting participation of lower or equal than 100%
data_perc <- subset(data, voting_part <= 100)

# population per square miles vs voting participation
scatter(data_perc, xvar ='pop_sqmiles', yvar = 'voting_part', 1/20, xscale = FALSE, 
        yscale = FALSE, coord = FALSE)
```

There is a weak negative correlation between the people per square mile and voting 
particpation (-0.29). If a tract has more people per square mile the voting 
participation is lower.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# boxplot for voting participation per type
boxplot(data_perc, 'type', 'voting_part', 1/5, 
        yscale = TRUE, 100, 5, coord = FALSE)
```

Voting participation increases with less urbanization, from 37.5% in urbanized 
areas to 47.5% in rural areas.

#### Vs % party votes
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# population per square miles vs Republican votes
scatter(data_perc, xvar ='pop_sqmiles', yvar = 'rep', 1/20, xscale = FALSE, 
        yscale = FALSE, coord = FALSE)
```

There is a negative relationship (-0.51) between the population per square mile
and the perentage of the votes for the Republican party. Relationship becomes
more strong when the density is higher, this is probably due that the most dense
areas are voting Democratic. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# boxplot for party % per type
rep <- boxplot(data, 'type', 'rep', 1/10, yscale = TRUE, 100, 5, coord = FALSE)
dem <- boxplot(data, 'type', 'dem', 1/10, yscale = TRUE, 100, 5, coord = FALSE)

grid.arrange(rep, dem, ncol = 2)
```

It is pretty clear that the Republican party median percentage of the votes is 
half in urban areas. The opposite is true for the Democratic party. The Republican
party is also more popular in urban clusters.

#### Vs household size

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# boxplot for household size per type
boxplot(data, 'type', 'total_hhsize', 1/10, yscale = FALSE, coord = FALSE)
```

Households seems to be the largest in the urbanized areas.They also have the 
most outliers (households with more than 5 members). 

### Median income
```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}
# show median income on map of California to show income distribution
map(ggcounties, data_geo, TRUE, 
    'cut_number(median_income/1000, 7, boundary = 0)') +
  scale_fill_brewer('median income in 1000 dollars', palette = 'PuBu', 
                    na.value = 'wheat')
```

The median income is higher on the tracts along the coast and in highly populated
areas. The San Franciso Bay area, Monterrey, Santa Barbara and the greater LA and
see the highest median incomes. As showed before, median income is higher in 
urbanized areas.

#### Vs voting participation

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# plot voting participaton vs median income
scatter(data_perc, 'median_income', 'voting_part', 1/20, 
        xscale = FALSE, yscale = FALSE, coord = FALSE)
```

The voting participation (total votes divided by the population) per tract is 
reasonable strong positively correlated (0.59) with the median income. If the 
median income is higher in a tract, also a bigger part of the population voted.

#### Vs winner
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# boxplot for median income per winner
boxplot(data_vot, 'winner', 'median_income', 1/10, 
        yscale = TRUE, 250000, 20000, coord = FALSE)
```

The median income for tracts were the Republican party was the largest is higher 
than in tracts where the Democratic party was the largest, but not by much. The 
tracts where the Democratic party was larger there are more outliers.

#### Vs owner
Households who owns their house correlates reasonable strong positvely (0.61) 
with the median income.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# median income vs ownership
scatter(data, 'median_income', 'owner', 1/25, 
        xscale = FALSE, yscale = FALSE, coord = FALSE)
```

If a higher percentage of a tract owns their homes, the median income is also 
higher. As you have to have more income in general to be able to by a house, 
this is not a surprise that these variables move together.

#### Vs unemployment

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# unemployment rate vs median income
scatter(data, 'median_income', 'unemployment_rate', 1/20, xscale = FALSE, 
        yscale = FALSE, coord = TRUE, col = data$unemployment_rate, ci = 0.99)
```

Unemployment rate in a tract and the median income are negatively correlated 
(-0.53). Expected, as higher unemployment rates correlate with lower median
incomes. 

#### Vs poverty

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# unemployment rate vs median income
scatter(data, 'median_income', 'poverty_rate', 1/25, xscale = FALSE, 
        yscale = FALSE, coord = TRUE, col = data$poverty_rate, ci = 0.99)
```

As one can expect there is also a strong negative correlation (-0.73) between the 
poverty rate and the median income in a tract. The poverty and unemployment rate
are also positively correlated (0.57), which is also not surprising as these 
variables move hand in hand.

### Winner
The Democratic party was the largest in 80% of the tracts, if we however plot 
this on the map, California looks mostly red (Republicans).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# plot the party that got the most votes
political <- map(ggcounties, data_geo, TRUE, 'winner') +
  scale_fill_manual('Party', values = c('dodgerblue3', 'firebrick1'), 
                    na.value ='wheat')

political
```

#### Vs square miles
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# boxplot square miles vs winner
boxplot(data_vot, 'winner', 'square_miles', 1/10, yscale = TRUE, yend = 60, 
        ystep = 5, coord = TRUE, col = data$square_miles, ci = 0.95)
```

Most of the tracts where the Democrats won are much smaller than the tracts were 
the Republicans won. The distribution for the Democrats is very longtailed though, 
75% of the tracts are smaller than 1.12 square mile. Only 95% of the values are 
shown in order to show the boxplot for the Democrats. As we have seen before the
population per square miles shows the opposite, Democrats won in more densely 
populated areas.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(subset(subset(data_vot, winner == 'Democrats'))$square_miles)
```

#### Vs poverty & unemployment rates

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pov <- boxplot(data_vot, 'winner', 'poverty_rate', 1/10, yscale = TRUE, 
               yend = 100, ystep = 5, coord = TRUE, col = data$poverty_rate, 
               ci = 0.99) 

unempl <- boxplot(data_vot, 'winner', 'unemployment_rate', 1/10, yscale = TRUE, 
                  yend = 100, ystep = 5, coord = TRUE, 
                  col = data$unemployment_rate, ci = 0.999)

grid.arrange(pov, unempl)
```

The median poverty rate is higher for Democratic (14.4%) tracts than for Republican 
tracts (10%). The median unemployment rate is however pretty similar for both at
9.2-3%. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# calculate medians for the two groups
med_winner <- data_vot %>% 
  group_by(winner) %>% 
  dplyr :: summarise(median_poverty = median(poverty_rate),
                     median_unemployment = median(unemployment_rate))

knitr::kable(med_winner)
```

#### Vs voting participation

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# boxplot winner vs voting participation
boxplot(data_perc, 'winner', 'voting_part', 1/10, yscale = TRUE, 100, 10, 
        coord = FALSE) 
```

Voting participation in Democratic tracts (~35%) is lower than in Republican 
tracts (~46%). There are more outliers for tracts where the Republicans won, 
both on the top and the bottom. 

#### Vs household size
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# boxplot winner vs household size
boxplot(data_vot, 'winner', 'total_hhsize', 1/10, yscale = TRUE, 7, 1, 
        coord = FALSE) 
```

The household size in Democrat tracts seems to be slightly higher. The plot also
shows that the tracts with larger households (above 5) are where the Democrats
won. 

#### Vs owner
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# boxplot winner vs owner
boxplot(data_vot, 'winner', 'owner', 1/10, yscale = TRUE, 100, 10, 
        coord = FALSE) 
```

Ownership is higher (70% +) in tracts where Republicans won. Ownership in 
Democratic tracts is much lower (+ 50%). The Democratic distribution seems 
however almostperfectly symmetrical. There are quite some outliers for the 
Republican tracts.

### Voting participation
Voting participation correlates with many variables in this dataset. Note that we 
only plot tracts where voting participation was below 100%. For 11 tracts the 
voting participation is higher which seems to be due to incorrect data. Therefore 
I am bit reluctant about the results for this variable as the higher correlations
found might be due to data errors. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create intervals for cut_format function
breaks_vp <- c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90)

# show voting participation on map of California
map(ggcounties, subset(data_geo, voting_part <= 100 | is.na(voting_part)), TRUE, 
    'cut_format(voting_part, breaks_vp)') +
  scale_fill_brewer('voting participation', palette = 'BuGn', 
                    na.value = 'wheat')
```

Voting participation is particularly low in the Central valley. Wondering what
can cause this. Little interest for politics is one, but it might also be caused
by big families or people that are not allowed to vote which both increase the
population but not the number of votes. 

#### Vs household size

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# household size vs voting participation
scatter(data_perc, 'total_hhsize', 'voting_part', 1/20, xscale = FALSE, 
        yscale = TRUE, yend = 100, ystep = 10, coord = FALSE)
```

Voting partipation is significantly negatively correlated with household size 
(-0.6). How more people live in an average household, a smaller percentage in 
the tract voted. Probably due that bigger households, generate more population 
but not in the same way the total number of votes as children are not allowed to
vote. There is not much difference in the correlation with household size for 
renters or owners (-0.51 and -0.5 respecitvely). 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# calculate correlations
hh_cor <- psych :: lowerCor(data_vot[,c('voting_part', 'renter_hhsize', 
                                        'owner_hhsize')], digits = 2)
```

#### Vs owner

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# owner vs voting participation
scatter(data_perc, 'owner', 'voting_part', 1/10, xscale = TRUE, xend = 100, 
        xstep = 10, yscale = TRUE, yend = 100, ystep = 10, coord = FALSE)
```

It seems that if tract has a larger percentage of the households who own their 
house also a bigger percentage has voted (0.48). The distribution is however 
very wide even though a upward movement is visible.

#### Vs poverty rate

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# owner vs voting participation
scatter(data_perc, 'voting_part', 'poverty_rate', 1/20, xscale = TRUE, 
        xend = 100, xstep = 10, yscale = TRUE, yend = 100, ystep = 10, 
        coord = TRUE, data$poverty_rate, ci = 0.999)
```

There is a relatively strong negative correlation (-0.62) between voter 
participation and the poverty rate in a tract. When the poverty rate is lower, 
more people casted their vote. The distribution looks a bit concave. 

#### Vs unemployment rate

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# unemployment rate vs voting participation
scatter(data_perc, 'voting_part', 'unemployment_rate', 1/10, xscale = TRUE, 
        xend = 100, xstep = 10, yscale = TRUE, yend = 100, ystep = 10, 
        coord = TRUE, data$unemployment_rate, ci = 0.999)
```

There is a negative correlation between the unemployment rate and the voting 
participation rate (-0.42). When unemployment is higher in a tract a smaller 
percentage voted. There are some tracts that have very high unemployment rates 
which I do not show in the plot.

### Winner vs type
I thought it would be interesting to split tracts on both the winner as well as 
the type variable. Used this [tutorial](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/tables.html).
It is very clear that tracts are more likely to have voted Democratic if they are 
marked as urbanized areas, same is true for rural areas and Republican. For 
urban centers there is a 50:50 divide between the two winners. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create contingency table for winner and type variables
tbl <-table(data$type, data$winner)

# calculate the percentage of a type voted Dems or Reps
table2 <- prop.table(tbl, 1)

# create mosaicplot showing breakdown per type of winner
mosaicplot(table2, main = 'Breakdown of tracts', 
           color = c('dodgerblue3', 'firebrick1'), # colors
           las = 1, cex.axis = 1) # text direction and size
```

### Summary
#### Main variables
The population per square mile variable does not correlate strongly with any of 
the other variables in the dataset. Moderate correlations with the owner (-0.55) 
and party variables (0.52/-0.51).

The median income correlates moderately with the unemployment rate (-0.53), 
owner (0.61) and voting participation (0.59). It correlates more strongly with
the poverty rate (-0.73), which is expected. 

The winner variable shows that Democratic tracts are smaller, are more densely 
populated, have lower median incomes, lower ownership rates, higher poverty rates, 
similar unemployment rates and lower voting participation, but slightly larger 
households than Republican tracts. As there are more Democratic tracts the range 
of values are more diverse and there are multiple outliers. 

The newly introduced type variable shows that urbanized ares have the highest 
median incomes, the lowest ownership, voting participation, poverty and 
unemployment rates, the largest households and the lowest % of votes for the 
Republican party. All variables become larger or smaller when moving to the 
urban center and rural tracts. Except for the poverty rate which is the highest 
in urban centers.

Urbanized tracts are most likely tracts where the Democratic party got the most 
votes. In rural tracts the Republican party was more likely to have won. For urban 
centers it was half half. 

#### Other variables
The voting participation is the variable that correlates with many other 
variables although moderate. Positively with ownership (0.48) and the median
income (0.59), negatively with poverty rate (-0.62) and household size (-0.6). 
The total votes and population per tract, that are used to calculate this 
variable are coming from different datasets, so there might be errors as was 
already indicated by the fact that some tracts had a voting participation higher 
than 100. When these tracts are removed, the correlation with the other variables 
however even increases with 2 a 3 procent point. 

#### Strongest correlation
The strongest correlation are between the dem and rep variables (0.99), but as 
these are percentage that add up and both make up most of the votes this is not
surprising. The second and third largest correlation are between the total 
household size and renter and owner household size variables (resp. 0.84 and 
0.88) also no surprise here, as the total household size is the based of the other 
two. The fourth largest correlation is between the median income and the poverty 
rate variables (-0.73). These variables are also expected to relate to each other. 
No real surprises here

# Multivariate Plots Section
The median poverty rate in urban centers was higher (17.4%) than in the areas.
This was unique as for all other variables, the median would rise or fall when
moving from most densely to least populated tracts.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
# calculate medians for the three types
medians_type <- data %>% group_by(type) %>% 
  dplyr :: summarise(median_poverty = median(poverty_rate),
                     median_income = median(median_income))

knitr::kable(medians_type)
```

I wanted to see if the poverty rates in the urban clustered were correlated with
median income and if there was any difference between Republican and Democratic
tracts. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create subset for urban clusters
clusters <- subset(data, type == 'urban clusters' & !is.na(winner))

# count nr of tracts per winner
clusters_winner <- clusters %>% group_by(winner) %>% 
  dplyr :: summarise( number_of_tracts = n())

knitr :: kable(clusters_winner)
```

There are 506 tracts that are marked as urbanized clusters (excluding tracts that 
did not have voter results). For little over half (54%) of these tract the 
Republican party was the largest.

### On the map
I mapped the poverty rates and the winner on the tracts that are marked as urban
clusters.  

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# find center coordinates of tracts
xy <- as.data.frame(coordinates(tracts_all))
tracts_df <- as.data.frame(tracts_all)

# create new table with tract Id and the coordinates
coordinates <- cbind(xy, tracts_df[,c('GEOID')])
names(coordinates) <- c('long', 'lat', 'Id')
coordinates$Id <- as.character(coordinates$Id)

# add coordinates to data
data <- left_join(data, coordinates, by = c('Id' = "Id"))
```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# recrate clusters with lat and long coordinates
clusters <- subset(data, type == 'urban clusters' & !is.na(winner))

# basic map of California with county borders
map_combi <- map(ggcounties, subset(data_geo, type == 'urban clusters' & 
                                      !is.na(winner)), TRUE, 'winner') +
  # fill color for the tracts based on winner
  scale_fill_manual('Party', values = c('dodgerblue3', 'firebrick1'), 
                    na.value ='wheat') +
  # add center point per tract
  geom_point(data = clusters, 
             mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = NULL, 
                           color = poverty_rate), size = 0.2) +
  # color for points based on the poverty rate
  scale_color_gradient('Poverty rate in %', low = 'yellow', high ='black') +
  # add title
  ggtitle('Biggest party and poverty rate for urban center tracts')

map_combi
```

As some tracts are small it is hard to see if most votes went to the Democratic
or Republican party and the color of the dot indicating the poverty rate. 
However there are a couple of things that catch the eye. 

It seems that the tracts are grouped with other tracts where the same party won. 
Coastal tracts and tracts in the valley voted mostly Democratic. In the bigger 
tracts the Republican mostly won. It is not super clear but the tracts where the 
poverty rate was the highest (40 and above) seem to be ones where the Democratic 
party got the most votes. Low poverty rates are mostly found in Republican 
tracts.

### In a scatterplot
As the results were not super clear due to the size of some tracts I opt for an
other approach. I decided to look at the correlation between the poverty rate and
median income in the different type of tracts in scatterplots.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# function for calculating correlation between median income and poverty rate
# for certain subset based on splitting variable (var)
correlation <- function(data, var) {
  c <- ddply(data, var, summarise, 
              cor = round(cor(median_income, poverty_rate),3))
  c
}

# create multiple scatterplots split on facet
scatter_multi <- function(data, var, facet, x, y, position){
  
  # calling correlation function
  cor <- correlation(data, var) 
  
  p <- ggplot(data = data, aes(x = poverty_rate, y = median_income)) +
    geom_jitter(aes(color = winner), size = 0.3, alpha = 1/2) +
    # color & label for points
    scale_color_manual('Party', values = c('dodgerblue3', 'firebrick1')) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 20)) +
    scale_y_continuous(label = comma, trans ='log10') +
    # create plot for every facet
    facet_grid(facet) +
    # add the correlation coefficient as a label
    geom_text(data = cor, size = 3, 
              aes(label = paste('r =', cor, sep = ' ')), x = x, y = y) +
    # add axes labels
    xlab('Poverty rate in %') +
    ylab('Median income in USD (on log scale)') +
    #location of legend
    theme(legend.position = position)
  
  p
}
```

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# income vs poverty rate split on type
scatter_multi(data_vot,'type', ~type, 75, 5.4, 'top')
```

The correlation for the whole dataset was -0.73. If we look at the subsets based 
on type (level of urbanization) the correlation is the highest for the urban 
centers (0.75). We also see that almost all tracts with a poverty rate above 40% 
in the urban clusters voted Democratic. 

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# income vs poverty rate split on winner and type
inc_pov <- scatter_multi(data_vot, c('type','winner'), 
                          winner~type, 75, 5.4, 'none')

inc_pov
```

If we split the data up in 6 groups based on type and winner, we see that the 
correlation is highest (-0.797) for urban clusters where the Democratic party 
got the most votes. 

It is also visible that there are more tracts with an income above 100,000 dollars
in urbanized areas and that in urbanized areas and urban clusters lower median 
incomes are more likely in Democratic tracts. The highest poverty rates are more 
likely to be in Democratic tracts. Except for rural areas where the distribution 
looks pretty similar which is also reflected in the correlation coefficient. 

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# calculate medians
medians <- ddply(clusters, 'winner', summarise, 
                 pov_rate = median(poverty_rate),
                 median_y = median(median_income))

# urban cluster split on winner
scatter_multi(clusters, 'winner', ~winner, 50, 5.05, 'none') +
  # x intercept showing the median poverty_rate
  geom_vline(data = medians, aes(xintercept = pov_rate), 
             linetype = 6, color = 'grey0') +
  geom_text(data = medians, size = 3, x = 32, y = 4.31, color = 'grey0',
            aes(label = paste('median =', pov_rate, sep = ' '))) +
  # y intercept showing the median median_income
  geom_hline(data = medians, aes(yintercept = median_y), linetype = 5, color = 'lightslategrey') +
  geom_text(data = medians, size = 3, x = 47, y = 4.74, color = 'lightslategrey',
              aes(label = paste('median =', median_y, sep = ' ')))
```

If we split the urban cluster distribution per winning party. It shows
even more clear that for Democratic tracts the poverty rate and median income 
are more highly correlated (-0.80). The Democratic distribution is leaner and 
less whimsical as the Republican. 

We also see that the median poverty for Democratic tracts is higher 21.1% (vs
15.9%). The median median income in Republican tracts is higher (49,562.5 vs 
44,212 dollars). So a median Democratic tract has a higher poverty rate and lower
median income.

#### Mann-Whitney U test
If we look at the distribution of the poverty rate in these histograms, we see
that the distributions are not normal, especially the Democratic one has multiple
peaks. 

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# histograms for urban centers per winner
ggplot(data = clusters, aes(x = poverty_rate, color = as.factor(winner))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = 'white') +
  # add median
  geom_vline(data = medians, aes(xintercept = pov_rate, color = winner), 
             linetype = 1) +
  # colors for bars
  scale_color_manual(values = c('dodgerblue3', 'firebrick1')) +
  facet_wrap(~winner) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

As the distributions are not normally distributed we can use the [Mann–Whitney 
U test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test) to test if 
the distributions are indeed non-similar. This is a nonparametric test which 
tests that it is equally likely that the poverty rate for a randomly selected 
Democratic tract will be greater than the poverty rate for a randomly selected 
Republican tract. 

H0: D1 and D2 are identical
Ha: D1 is shifted to the right of D2

D1 is the probability distribution for Democratic tracts, D2 is the probability 
distribution for Republican tracts.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'markup'}
# calculate Mann Whitney U
wilcox.test(data = clusters, poverty_rate~winner, paired = FALSE)
```

The distributions in the two groups differs significantly. We can therefore 
conclude that poverty rates in Democratic tracts exceed the poverty rates for
Republican tracts for this dataset (Mann–Whitney U = 39,728, n_Democrats = 232, 
n_Republicans = 274, P < 0.01 one-tailed).

## Summary
The median poverty rate was highest in urban centers (17.4%), when looking
at the correlation between the median income and poverty rate it became clear
that also the correlation was the highest in these tracts (0.75). When we split
up the urban center tracts to who got the most votes, Democratic tracts showed
an even higher correlation (0.80 vs 71%) and a much higher median poverty rate 
of 21.1% (vs 15.9%) and lower median income (44,212 vs 49,563) than Republican 
tracts. So it seems that the higher median poverty rate for urban clusters was 
mostly caused by Democratic tracts with high median poverty rates.

# Final Plots and Summary
### Plot One
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_One}
political +
  ggtitle('Biggest party per census tract (presidential election 2016)')
```

California is always described as a Democratic state. If you however look at this
map it shows a different picture. Ofcourse it is misleading as we have seen that
tracts that where Republicans are bigger and less dense populated. As result the
Democratic party is the biggest in California, but it makes clear there is not 
one California and there are many areas in California where the Republican party 
is very present.

### Plot Two
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Two}
inc_pov
```

This overview of scatterplots shows the relations between the median income and 
the poverty rate. What catches the eye is the strong relation between the 
variables for Democratic urban clusters. 

The poverty rates are lower in the Republican tracts as we can seen as the tracts 
are more clustered at the lower rates. The same is true for the median income 
Republican tracts are more clustered in the higher income ranks. The maximum 
poverty rates are found in the Democratic tracts (except for the rural tracts). 
This overview also shows very clear how many tracts are marked as urbanized areas
and how many of these tracts voted Democratic. 
  
### Plot Three
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Three}
map_combi
```

Unfortunately this map did not come out as nice as it could be as there are so
many tracts and especially the small ones make it hard to add an additional 
variable.

That said, it is still interesting to see that there are clusters of tracts that
voted either Republican or Democratic. The Democratic cluster in the middle of 
the state is interesting. I am wondering as this is an agricultural area and 
if it therefore also sees high poverty rates. Almost all black dots (poverty rate 
of 50% and above) are found in Democratic tracts. 

# Reflection
### Challenges
The first challenge was to find all the different data and combine them to one
dataset. It was surprisingly that broadband and census data was available per 
census tract. I thought it would be easy to combine this with the voting data. 
Unfortunately that proved to be a bit more difficult as voting results were 
available per precinct instead of census tracts. It took a bit to figure out how
to combine the different voting datasets to get the the voting results per 
census tract.

After all this time-consuming work it seems that something went wrong as voting
participation was too high in some tract. Probably votes have been assigned 
incorrectly when mapping from precincts to blocks. I have gone over this a couple 
of times and I cannot find where it goes wrong in my mapping, so I am not sure 
if there is something in the original mapping files (there was also an issue with
votes in the middle of water tracts) or my method. It can also be caused by the 
fact that the population data was coming from a different dataset.

I was also struggling finding relations, I kind of hoped for relations between 
population density and broadband speed for one. But there was nothing there. It 
was only for the categorical variables (winner and type), which made for some 
interesting findings. However both were created so might not be too reliable. 

### Successes
I am new to R, so plotting the results on maps, was a bit of challenge but with 
insights from different tutorial (marked in main text), I figured out how to
customize this for my use. To be honest I still do not totally understand what is
happening exactly, but it works!

###Future research
It would be interesting to explore further if something is wrong with the voting 
data and for example look further into why the voting participation is so much 
higher in rural areas? Maybe compare total votes versus population over 18 to 
get a cleaner rate.
